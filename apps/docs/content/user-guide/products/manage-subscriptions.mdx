# Manage Subscriptions

In this document, you will learn how to create and manage subscriptions for products. This includes creating new subscriptions, editing existing ones, and more.

Customers have two options for subscribing to products:

1. On the checkout page, they can choose to purchase the product as a one-time purchase, or they can subscribe for recurring deliveries.
2. Subscribe to Subscription Box.

## Subscribe on Checkout

This is how it look like on standard checkout page, customers have two options Onetime and Subscription.

### Delivery interval

For delivery intervals, you have two options.

1. **Customer Defined Delivery:** allowing customers to set their own delivery schedule according to their needs.
2. **Predefined interval:** you can predefine the delivery interval, such as setting the subscription box to be delivered on the 3rd of each month. In this case, customers will not be able to change the delivery schedule.

### Expire Subscription Automatically

In the delivery interval section, you can specify the total number of deliveries for a subscription. Once this limit is reached, the subscription will automatically cancel. If you leave it set to unlimited, the subscription will never expire, and you will need to cancel it manually if needed. This feature provides flexibility in managing subscription durations and customer expectations.

### Orders Opening and Closing

You can set specific opening and closing dates for orders, allowing customers to place orders only within these designated periods.

#### Cease Orders

By default, the "cease order" option is enabled, preventing customers from placing orders after the closing date or before the opening date. If you disable this option, customers will be informed about the order closing but can still place orders, which will be shown in the upcoming section of your orders for easy management. Check [Order Guide](../orders/#view-list-of-upcoming-orders) to learn more.

## Subscribable and Onetime Purchase Variants

By default, all variants under a subscription box are set to be subscribable. However, if you wish to offer any variant as a one-time purchase only, you can enable the **One time purchase** option. This feature is specific to subscription boxes, allowing flexibility in your sales strategy. Many businesses use different pricing for one-time purchases compared to subscriptions, often charging a lower amount for subscriptions to encourage recurring payments.
