To create a new library file:

1. Go to the Libraries page.
2. Find the library in which you want to add new file, click on it.
3. In library detail page click on the **Create new File** button at the top right.

This opens a new form with different sections. Here you have to select the file type and enter required data.

## File Restrictions

There are two types of restrictions.

1. Restrict file to access without purchase.
2. Periodic Restriction allows you to limit access to digital content based on specific time intervals. Customers can only access this content if they purchase the product within the defined period.

### Restrict File
Restrict the file so customer can't access it without purchase.
