## Manual

Manual payment systems, such as cash on delivery (COD) or customer pay manual methods, require the store owner to handle payment processing directly, without the use of automated systems. In cash on delivery, customers pay for goods at the time of delivery, while in other manual payment methods, customers might pay through bank transfers or checks. These systems necessitate the store owner to manually track and verify payments, update inventory, and manage order statuses, often involving additional steps for record-keeping and reconciliation. While manual payment systems can offer flexibility and accessibility to customers, they can also increase the administrative workload for store owners.

Manual payment is by default setup on your store.
