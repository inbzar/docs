## Integrate other Third Party Chat

You can integrate any third-party live chat widgets into your storefront.
Most of third party will provide you a `<script>` code.

To implement this script, contact our developer support and let them know you want to integrate it into your store. They will do this for you at no cost. We don't offer this feature directly and require a developer's assistance to avoid potential security risks. Pasting scripts can pose security threats, and many store owners may not understand the risks of integrating unknown code, which could lead to sensitive information, such as credit card or password details, being compromised. Our professional developers ensure the code is secure before implementing it on your storefront. This service is completely free from InBzar.
