## Features

### Customer Accounts

Customers can make purchases as guests, or they can create an account.

When a customer creates an account, they can manage their details and review their order history.

An admin can manage all customers and their details.

    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['users-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to manage customers in InBzar Admin.'
    }
  },
]} />

### Customer Groups

Admins can segment customers or assign them to different customer groups. This can be useful for marketing purposes.

For example, an admin can specify a different pricing or special discounts for specific customer groups.
