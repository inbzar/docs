# Personal Payment System

Personal Payment System empowers you to integrate your own payment methods, including PayPal, Stripe, or other manual systems, ensuring all payments go directly into your account without any transaction fees. Unlike other platforms, InBzar does not hold your funds or charge commissions. This system keeps all customer subscriptions active in your account, eliminating vendor lock-in and allowing you to move your customers freely. By using your own payment system, InBzar fosters a stronger relationship between you and your customers.
