# Multi-Warehouse

Multi-warehouse allows merchants to store a product in multiple locations with accurate and consistent inventory data within the commerce application.

---

## Features

### Multiple Stock Locations

Admins can manage the stock locations, which are the places they store their products. Stock locations are associated with different sales channels.

<DocCardList colSize={6} items={[
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/user-guide/multiwarehouse/locations',
    label: 'User Guide: Manage Stock Locations',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['users-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to manage stock locations in InBzar Admin.'
    }
  },
]} />

### Inventory Management Across Locations

Admins can manage the inventory of product variants across the different stock locations.

<DocCardList colSize={6} items={[
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/user-guide/multiwarehouse/inventory',
    label: 'User Guide: Manage Inventory',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['users-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to manage inventory using the InBzar Admin.'
    }
  },
]} />

### Manage Item Allocations in Orders

Admins can manage item allocations to choose which stock location to fulfill items from or return items to. Item quantities are reserved in a stock location until the item is fulfilled to ensure data consistency.

<DocCardList colSize={6} items={[
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/user-guide/orders/manage#manage-item-allocation',
    label: 'User Guide: Manage Allocations in Orders',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['users-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to manage allocations of items in an order using the InBzar Admin.'
    }
  },
]} />
