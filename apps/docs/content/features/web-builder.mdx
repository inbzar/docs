# Web Builder

Web Builder lets you personalize your theme with flexibility and precision. Create and edit pages using pre-built blocks that you can rearrange to fit your needs. Unlike traditional drag-and-drop builders, which can impact performance and responsiveness, InBzar’s Web Builder offers a more efficient approach. For those familiar with HTML and CSS, you can design and add custom blocks. Alternatively, use any drag-and-drop tool to create blocks and simply copy and paste them into InBzar’s Web Builder for seamless integration.
