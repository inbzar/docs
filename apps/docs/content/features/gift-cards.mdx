## Features

### Gift Card Management

Admins can manage their main gift card with unlimited denominations.

<DocCardList colSize={6} items={[
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/user-guide/gift-cards/manage',
    label: 'User Guide: Manage Discounts',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['users-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to manage gift cards using InBzar Admin.'
    }
  },
]} />

### Gift Card Purchasing

Customers can view the gift card and purchase it on the storefront. Customers can also use the gift card during checkout to deduct the gift card’s balance from the checkout total.

### Custom Gift Cards

Admins can create custom gift cards that are sent to specific customers. These customers can then use the gift card during checkout, the same way they would if they purchased one.

<DocCardList colSize={6} items={[
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/user-guide/gift-cards/custom',
    label: 'User Guide: Custom Gift Cards',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['users-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to manage custom gift cards using InBzar Admin.'
    }
  },
]} />
