# Subscription Box with Onetime and Recurring Payment

In this guide you will learn how to setup Subscription Box with both onetime and recurring payment options.

## Overview

Subscription boxes are a unique product offering that combine multiple items into a single box, providing a curated experience for customers. Subscription boxes are a rapidly growing sector in e-commerce, offering a convenient and personalized shopping experience. They provide customers with a variety of products delivered regularly to their doorsteps, often based on a specific theme or niche.

Providing both one-time and recurring payment options caters to different customer preferences, increasing flexibility and potentially boosting sales. One-time purchases attract customers who prefer trying the product without commitment, while recurring payments build a steady revenue stream and enhance customer loyalty.

Many businesses utilize different pricing strategies for one-time purchases compared to subscriptions, often incentivizing subscriptions by offering them at a lower cost. This guide will walk you through the steps needed to set up both one-time and recurring payment options for your subscription box.

## Get Started
