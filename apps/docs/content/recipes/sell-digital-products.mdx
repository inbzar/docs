# Sell Digital Products

In this guide you will learn how to create and sell digital products on InBzar.

## Overview

Our platform guides you through the process of uploading, managing, and delivering digital content, allowing you to offer files, documents, and media to your customers with ease. 

## Get Started

### 1. Create Digital Shipping

We need to create a new shipping option for digital products, as they don't require physical shipping. This involves setting up a shipping method with no cost, simply to ensure the checkout process can be completed smoothly.

Check user guide how to [Manage Shipping Options in a Region](/user-guide/regions/shipping-options) and then create new shipping option with **flat rate** and **0 amount**.

### 2. Create a Product

Creating a new digital product follows the same process as creating any other product. For detailed instructions, check [user guide on managing products](/user-guide/products/manage).

### 3. Create Library for Product
Create a new library and attach your digital product to it. Then, add files to this library and set them as restricted, ensuring that customers can only access the content after purchase.

Check user guide how to [Manage libraries](/user-guide/digital-library/manage).
