# Simple Product without Variant Selection

In this guide you will learn how to create simple product without variant selection, customer does not have to select any variant. Actually this type of product is not without variant but it contain at least one variant if you create product with one variant it is default selected and customer does not have to select the variant.

## Overview

Simple products are standalone items that do not come in multiple variations such as size, color, or style. Each product in this category is unique and does not offer alternative options or configurations. These products are typically straightforward and easy to manage, making them ideal for businesses looking to streamline inventory and simplify the purchasing process.

Simple products are ideal for businesses seeking to offer straightforward purchasing options without the need for customers to choose from various attributes or options.

## Get Started

### 2. Create Single Variant

We have to create at least one variant.

You must add an option before you can add variants.

1. Add a new option by clicking the “Add an option” button.
    - This shows two new fields: the Title and the Variations fields. For the title field, use **Variant** and for the variation field, use **single**. These are not special names, so feel free to choose any names you prefer.

2. Add a new variant by clicking the “Add a variant” button. In the new window that opens:
    - Enter the required fields and Select a value for the variant option, ensuring there is only one option, **single**, if that is the name you used previously. If you chose different names in earlier steps, those names will appear here instead.

You can add prices for the variants after the product has been created using [the bulk editor](/user-guide/products/manage#edit-product-prices).

That's it! Your simple product is ready. Since this product contains only one variant, customers will not see any variant selection options, and the variant will be automatically selected by default.
