# Sell E-Book

In this guide you will learn how to create and sell e-book with free preview and downloadable restricted downloadable link.

## Overview

In this example, we will sell an e-book with free preview content accessible to anyone without purchase, and the full e-book available upon purchase. We will also demonstrate how to deliver updated versions of the e-book to customers who have already made a purchase.

## Get Started

### 1. Create Digital Shipping

We need to create a new shipping option for digital products, as they don't require physical shipping. This involves setting up a shipping method with no cost, simply to ensure the checkout process can be completed smoothly.

To add a shipping option:

1. Go to Settings → Regions.
2. Select the shipping option's region.
3. Scroll down to the Shipping Options section on the right side.
4. Click on the Add Option button.
5. A new window will open with a form:
    - **Visible in Store:** check this box
    - **Title (Required):** The name of the shipping option.
    - **Price Type (Required):** It should be Flat Rate.
    - **Price:** Set to zero(0), because digital products does not have to ship anything.
    - **Shipping Profile (Required):** Select "Digital or Service Profile".
    - **Fulfillment Method (Required):** the fulfillment provider that will handle fulfilling this shipping option.
6. Once you’re done, click the "Save and close" button.
